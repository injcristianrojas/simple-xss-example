# Persistent XSS Demo Application

## Introduction

As part of my Software Security classes, I've decided to make this app which
simulates a persistent XSS attack, using a target server made using PHP and
a session-grabbing app made in PHP.

## Working the normal way

### Requirements

* PHP-CLI (Command Line Interface) 5.4.0 or better
* PHP PDO package (for sqlite3 support)

To fulfill these, do the following:

* For RPM-based systems (Fedora, RHEL, CentOS): `sudo yum install php-cli php-pdo`
* For DEB-based systems (Ubuntu, Debian): `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install php5-cli php5-sqlite`

### Usage

Start the session-grabbing server:

```Shell
php -S localhost:8181
```

Then start the target server:

```Shell
cd app
php -S localhost:8282
```

Go to the app at <http://localhost:8282> and have fun!

## Working the Docker way (Beta)

### Requirements

* Docker 1.3.2 or later

### Usage

Start the session-grabbing server. If this is your first time doing it, wait a
while. Docker must grab the php:5.6-apache image first:

```Shell
docker run -it --rm --name xss_grabbing_server -p 8181:80 php:5.6-apache
```

Next, the target server:

```Shell
docker run -it --rm --name xss_target_server -p 8282:80 -v "$(pwd)"/app:/var/www/html php:5.6-apache
```

Now, pay attention at the server logs on the grabbing server, go to
<http://localhost:8282> and have fun!
