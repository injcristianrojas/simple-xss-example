# Persistent XSS Demo Application

## Introduction

As part of my Software Security classes, I've decided to make this app which
simulates a persistent XSS attack, using a target server made using PHP and
a session-grabbing app made in PHP.

## Working the normal way

### Requirements

* PHP-CLI (Command Line Interface) 5.4.0 or better

### Usage

Start the session-grabbing server:

```Shell
php -S localhost:8181
```

Then start the target server:

```Shell
cd app
php -S localhost:8282
```

Go to the app at <http://localhost:8282> and have fun!

## Working the Docker way (Beta)

### Requirements

* Docker 1.3.2 or later

### Usage

First, start by building a server image:

```Shell
docker build -t xss-server-img .
```

Being done with the image, you can now start the containers needed. First, the
session-grabbing server:

```Shell
docker run -it --rm --name xss_grabbing_server -p 8181:80 xss-server-img
```

Next, the target server:

```Shell
docker run -it --rm --name xss_target_server -p 8282:80 xss-server-img
```

Now, pay attention at the server logs on the grabbing server, go to
<http://localhost:8282> and have fun!
